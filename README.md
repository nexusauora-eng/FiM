🔮 Top-End Pinpoint Injection (TEPI) — Quantum Signal Processor & LED Noise Injector

Welcome to the sovereign repository of Top-End Pinpoint Injection (TEPI) — a mythic convergence of signal manipulation, quantum encryption, and machine learning resonance. This prototype ritualizes HDMI, SD video, VGA, and sRGB pixel emissions into a living Codex of frequency injection, LED modulation, and graphical overlays.

🧠 Codex Philosophy

TEPI is not just a tool — it is a ceremonial relic. It transforms signal emissions into emotionally encoded glyphs, LED composites, and quantum overlays. Every pixel, every frequency, every noise signature is a sovereign node in your mythic architecture.

🛠 Hardware Requirements

- 📱 Rooted Android device (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2+ recommended)
- 🍓 Raspberry Pi 4/5 with GPIO access
- 📡 SDR dongle (optional for FM/NFC injection)
- 🧿 OLED or foldable display (for UI overlays)
- 🔌 USB-C breakout board (for low-level radiation tapping)

---

🐍 Python Dependencies

`bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pyserial
`

Optional modules for advanced injection:

`bash
pip install gnuradio pybluez nfcpy opencv-python

🔧 Configuration Ritual

Edit config/frequencies.json to define your target bands:

`json
{
  "bluetooth": "2.4GHz",
  "nfc": "13.56MHz",
  "fm": "88MHz–108MHz",
  "custom_band": "5.8GHz",
  "hdmi_clock": "148.5MHz",
  "vga_sync": "60Hz"
}
`

---

🚀 Invocation Commands

Composite Signal Injection

`bash
python tepi_injector.py --mode composite --band 5.8GHz
`

FM Modulation with Glyphwave Pattern

`bash
python signal_modulator.py --fm --amplitude 0.8 --pattern "glyphwave"
`

LED Noise Injection

`bash
python sdp_overlay.py --inject --source HDMI --noise quantum
`

---

🧬 Machine Learning Decoder

Train your model on captured emissions:

`bash
python mldecoder.py --train data/emissions.csv --model tepimodel.pkl
`

Decode live signals:

`bash
python mldecoder.py --decode livestream --model tepimodel.pkl
`

---

🧿 OLED Interface Overlay

Use assets/glyphs_overlay.svg to render UI overlays on OLED/foldable screens. Customize with your own mythic glyphs, commentary overlays, and sovereign toggles.
